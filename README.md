<h3><b><i>3.

(a).

COVID-19 Pandemic has different economic impacts on the countries like India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia, which can be demonstrated from the varying degree of changes in each country’s GDP as well as unemployment rate during the Pandemic. First, let us have a look at each country’s unemployment rate to see how jobs are being lost worldwide.

With data from <i><b><font color = "red">Trading Economics (2020)<sup><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/india/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[1]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/india/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[2]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/brazil/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[3]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[4]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/indonesia/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[5]</a></sup></font></b><i>, here comes the line chart of quarterly unemployment rate (%) for India, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Indonesia and Brazil (Figure 3.a.1)

<i><font face='Times New Roman' size=2>Figure 3.a.1</font></i>
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src=" https://sdanj.github.io/QuarterlyUnemployment/" height="650" width="90%"></iframe>
<p style = 'text-align :center'><i><font face='Times New Roman' size=2>Figure 3.a.1</font></i></p>

We can see that all countries’ unemployment rate had risen after Q1 2020 except Indonesia (purple line). And among these countries, India (dark blue line) had the most obvious increase in unemployment rate from Q1 2020 to Q2 2020, then came Egypt (green line) and Brazil (orange line). For Sri Lanka, even though there was no data after Q1 2020, it could be seen that it had the tendency of an increasing unemployment rate.

Now, we had a basic idea about the condition of job losing in each 5 countries, it is a good time to look at how each country’ economic being influenced during the Pandemic. 

With data from <i><b><font color = "red">Trading Economics (2020)</font></b><i>, here comes the line chart of quarterly GDP growth rate (%) for India, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Indonesia and Brazil (Figure 3.a.2).

<i><font face='Times New Roman' size=2>Figure 3.a.2</font></i>
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://sdanj.github.io/QuarterlyGDP/" height="650" width="90%"></iframe>
<p style = 'text-align :center'><i><font face='Times New Roman' size=2>Figure 3.a.2</font></i></p>

It shows that most countries’ economy started to or had a tendency to shrink in and after Q1 2020 (the time around when the Pandemic began). Among these countries, India (blue line) seemed to have the most badly hurt economy with a rapid decline of GDP growth rate from 0.7 in Q1 2020 to -25.2 in Q2 2020. And for Indonesia (purple line) and Brazil (orange line), even though their economy was not attacked as severely as India’s, they were already or started being under a negative GDP growth rate in Q1 2020, and an obvious further decrease in GDP growth rate can be seen for both of them from Q1 2020 to Q2 2020. For Sri Lanka (red line), even though we do not have the GDP growth rate after Q1 2020, we can still tell that with a positive rate from 2 in Q4 2019 to a negative one -1.6 in Q1 2020, Sri Lanka’s economy displayed a contraction when reached Q1 2020. And for Egypt (green line), it is hard to tell what its economy would look like after Q1 2020, and it seemed like there was no big turbulence in Egypt’s economy: only a little decrease of rate from 5.6 in Q4 2019 to 5 in Q1 2020 for Egypt’s economy, and in that it still kept a positive growth rate of 5 in Q1 2020, there was no sign of a decrease in its GDP. 

To study the economy of Bangladesh and Pakistan during the Pandemic, yearly GDP that was predicted and computed based on current situation, provided by International Monetary Fund (2020), was used to see how these two countries’ economy would be affected. Here comes 2 line charts of Yearly GDP: one for Bangladesh and Pakistan (Figure 3.a.3). only and one for all 7 countries (Figure 3.a.4) to compare the varying seriousness of each 7 countries’ economy shocks. First, look at the line chart for Bangladesh and Pakistan’s Yearly GDP (Figure 3.a.3).

<i><font face='Times New Roman' size=2>Figure 3.a.3</font></i>
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://sdanj.github.io/YearGDP_BGD_PAK/" height="650" width="90%"></iframe>
<p style = 'text-align :center'><i><font face='Times New Roman' size=2>Figure 3.a.3</font></i></p>

For Pakistan (red line), it is not able to know how its economy would be affected during the Pandemic since no data is available now for its yearly GDP, even the predicted one, in 2020 or any further years, even though it did show the tendency of a decreasing GDP for year 2019. And for Bangladesh (blue line), it can be seen that even though it would keep having an increasing GDP, when it came to the year 2020, the growth rate of GDP would decrease (the slope of the line went flatter) and this growth rate would barely change until around the year 2021. Which means the economy of Bangladesh would still grow but would grow slowly after 2020. 

Now, have a look at to what degree would the economy of Pakistan and Bangladesh, or just Bangladesh, be affected when being compared among all 7 countries. 


Here is the line chart for all 7 countries’ Yearly GDP (Figure 3.a.4).

<i><font face='Times New Roman' size=2>Figure 3.a.4</font></i>
<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://sdanj.github.io/YearlyGDP/" height="650" width="90%"></iframe>
<p style = 'text-align :center'><i><font face='Times New Roman' size=2>Figure 3.a.4</font></i></p>

We can see that when putting Yearly GDP of Bangladesh and Pakistan in all the 7 countries’, these two countries (purple line and orange line) would not be affected as obviously as India (dark blue line) or Brazil (light blue line) which showed an obvious decline of GDP in the year 2020.

With above information, we can conclude that:

<span style="background-color:yellow"><b>India and Brazil were the two countries being hurt most badly in their economy. And for Indonesia and Sri Lanka, there showed a decrease in their GDP but not as bad as India and Brazil. For Bangladesh and Egypt, there would still be an increasing GDP but would be a slowly increasing one. Last, for Pakistan, it would be hard to tell since there was no enough data for its GDP in or after the year 2020.</b></span>
