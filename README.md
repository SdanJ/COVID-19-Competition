<h3><b><i>3. Jobs are being lost worldwide at an unprecedented rate, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic is not the same throughout each of these countries, what are the differences in these economic shocks? What responses have been and are being made to help mitigate this issue? Have they worked?</i></b></h3>


(a).

COVID-19 Pandemic has different economic impacts on the countries like India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia, which can be demonstrated from the varying degree of changes in each country’s GDP as well as unemployment rate during the Pandemic. First, let us have a look at each country’s unemployment rate to see how jobs are being lost worldwide.

With data from <i><b><font color = "red">Trading Economics (2020)<sup><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/india/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[1]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/india/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[2]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/brazil/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[3]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[4]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/indonesia/unemployment-rate' target='_blank'>[5]</a></sup></font></b><i>, here comes the line chart of quarterly unemployment rate (%) for India, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Indonesia and Brazil.

<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src=" https://sdanj.github.io/QuarterlyUnemployment/" height="650" width="90%"></iframe>


We can see that all countries’ unemployment rate had risen after Q1 2020 except Indonesia (purple line). And among these countries, India (dark blue line) had the most obvious increase in unemployment rate from Q1 2020 to Q2 2020, then came Egypt (green line) and Brazil (orange line). For Sri Lanka, even though there was no data after Q1 2020, it could be seen that it had the tendency of an increasing unemployment rate.

Now, we had a basic idea about the condition of job losing in each 5 countries, it is a good time to look at how each country’ economic being influenced during the Pandemic. 

With data from <i><b><font color = "red">Trading Economics (2020)<sup><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-growth' target='_blank'>[6]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/sri-lanka/gdp-growth-annual' target='_blank'>[7]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/brazil/gdp-growth' target='_blank'>[8]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/egypt/gdp-growth-annual' target='_blank'>[9]</a><a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/indonesia/gdp-growth' target='_blank'>[10]</a></sup></font></b><i>, here comes the line chart of quarterly GDP growth rate (%) for India, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Indonesia and Brazil.


<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://sdanj.github.io/QuarterlyGDP/" height="650" width="90%"></iframe>


It shows that most countries’ economy started to or had a tendency to shrink in and after Q1 2020 (the time around when the Pandemic began). Among these countries, India (blue line) seemed to have the most badly hurt economy with a rapid decline of GDP growth rate from 0.7 in Q1 2020 to -25.2 in Q2 2020. And for Indonesia (purple line) and Brazil (orange line), even though their economy was not attacked as severely as India’s, they were already or started being under a negative GDP growth rate in Q1 2020, and an obvious further decrease in GDP growth rate can be seen for both of them from Q1 2020 to Q2 2020. For Sri Lanka (red line), even though we do not have the GDP growth rate after Q1 2020, we can still tell that with a positive rate from 2 in Q4 2019 to a negative one -1.6 in Q1 2020, Sri Lanka’s economy displayed a contraction when reached Q1 2020. And for Egypt (green line), it is hard to tell what its economy would look like after Q1 2020, and it seemed like there was no big turbulence in Egypt’s economy: only a little decrease of rate from 5.6 in Q4 2019 to 5 in Q1 2020 for Egypt’s economy, and in that it still kept a positive growth rate of 5 in Q1 2020, there was no sign of a decrease in its GDP. 

To study the economy of Bangladesh and Pakistan during the Pandemic, yearly GDP that was predicted and computed based on current situation, provided by <i><b><font color = "red">International Monetary Fund (2020)<sup><a href='https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2020/October/select-country-group' target='_blank'>[11]</sup></a></font></b><i>, was used to see how these two countries’ economy would be affected. Here comes 2 line charts of Yearly GDP: one for Bangladesh and Pakistan only and one for all 7 countries to compare the varying seriousness of each 7 countries’ economy shocks. First, look at the line chart for Bangladesh and Pakistan’s Yearly GDP.

<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://sdanj.github.io/YearGDP_BGD_PAK/" height="650" width="90%"></iframe>


For Pakistan (red line), it is not able to know how its economy would be affected during the Pandemic since no data is available now for its yearly GDP, even the predicted one, in 2020 or any further years, even though it did show the tendency of a decreasing GDP for year 2019. And for Bangladesh (blue line), it can be seen that even though it would keep having an increasing GDP, when it came to the year 2020, the growth rate of GDP would decrease (the slope of the line went flatter) and this growth rate would barely change until around the year 2021. Which means the economy of Bangladesh would still grow but would grow slowly after 2020. 

Now, have a look at to what degree would the economy of Pakistan and Bangladesh, or just Bangladesh, be affected when being compared among all 7 countries. 


Here is the line chart for all 7 countries’ Yearly GDP.


<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://sdanj.github.io/YearlyGDP/" height="650" width="90%"></iframe>


We can see that when putting Yearly GDP of Bangladesh and Pakistan in all the 7 countries’, these two countries (purple line and orange line) would not be affected as obviously as India (dark blue line) or Brazil (light blue line) which showed an obvious decline of GDP in the year 2020.

With above information, we can conclude that:

<span style="background-color:yellow"><b>India and Brazil were the two countries being hurt most badly in their economy. And for Indonesia and Sri Lanka, there showed a decrease in their GDP but not as bad as India and Brazil. For Bangladesh and Egypt, there would still be an increasing GDP but would be a slowly increasing one. Last, for Pakistan, it would be hard to tell since there was no enough data for its GDP in or after the year 2020.</b></span>



(b).

Facing different degrees of economic shocks, each country applied different economic measures to mitigate the shocks. Below information was provided by <i><b><font color = "red">ACAPS (2020)<sup><a href='https://data.humdata.org/dataset/acaps-covid19-government-measures-dataset' target='_blank'>[12]</a></sup></font></b><i>.

Indonesia implemented several economic measures from 5/6/2020 to 7/20/2020, which included “APEC economies agree to keep markets open and trade flowing”, “The Government of Indonesia has announced a fund allocation of IDR. 695.2 trillion to mitigate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic, which includes IDR. 203.9 trillion for social assistance” and “The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs plans to re-start its pre-employment training program by opening a fourth batch of trainings by the end of July”.


(c).

All 7 countries had taken various economic measures during different time in 2020. To see if these measures had worked, 2 variables were used and treated as indicators here to show where the economy was headed: Workplace closing index and Income support index. These two indices could be found from the Research projects web page of the <i><b><font color = "red">Blavatnik School of Government in University of Oxford (2020)<sup><a href='https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker' tartget='_blank'>[13]</a></sup></font></b><i>. Closing workplace could have a huge impact on economic in that it would bring a reduction in the number of working people, and if there were more workplaces being closed, it would mean more people would take time off the work, and the economy might be being through a worse condition. And income support, which is used for helping people on a low income, could imply how bad the economic was since if there was more income support needed, it would mean more people were under a low income and the economy was in a worse condition. 

Based on above description and under the case that no governments among these countries were closing workplaces to force the economy ticking, changes in workplaces closing and income support before and after economic measures being applied could indicate and help us to learn how economy would change after economic measures being implemented. Here comes 2 line plots for the workplace closing index and income support index during the year 2020. The indices would show at what scale the workplace was closed or the income support was granted.

It can be shown from the line plot for the workplace closing index that most countries started to close their workplaces in March, the time around when the Pandemic arrived, and there was a drop in the scale of workplace closing for each country around the month June, the time when several measures were and being applied. And for Sri Lanka (green line), it had the most obvious drop in scale in June, then were India (dark blue line) and Bangladesh (purple line), and then were Brazil (light blue line), Indonesia (red line) and Pakistan (orange line). For Egypt (pink line), there was no change in scale from March to October. From the line plot of income support index, we can see that most countries started to provide income support around March and April, the time around when the Pandemic arrived, and it seemed like most countries (without data for Sri Lanka) were still keeping the scale of income support through the time, while India (dark blue line) and Bangladesh (purple line) had a drop in scale in September and May respectively. 


So, we can conclude that:

<span style="background-color:yellow"><b>Based on what workplace closing index and income support index indicated, it could be possible that the economy of India and Bangladesh was relived to the most extent after the economic measures was implemented, and then came Brazil, Indonesia and Pakistan. Foe Egypt, the economy might have not shown a relief yet. Last, it would be hard to say about Sri Lanka, even though it showed an obvious drop in scale of workplace closing, but without data from the other indicator, there might need more to learn about its economy. </b></span>
